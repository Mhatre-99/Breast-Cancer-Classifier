# Breast-Cancer-Detection
The objective is to have a learning exercise of applying machine learning fundamentals from an available dataset from Scikit learn datasets and further evaluate results and interpretation justify them. 
The analysis is focused on understanding the data, identifying the problem and performing analysis. Based on that, I have built a model to predict whether breast tissue is 'malignant' or 'benign'. 
In this notebook,I used data visualisation techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy. 
My aim is to construct a predictive model using SVM classification to predict the diagnosis of the breast tumor as it is a binary variable.
